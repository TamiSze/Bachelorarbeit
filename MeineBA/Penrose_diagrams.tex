\subsection{Penrose diagrams}
%\FloatBarrier
	We want to know the causal structure of spacetime by asking the question which points can receive signals from which other points. 
For throwing out some irrelevant information, we will know introduce the so called \textit{conformal compactification}.

We have two spacetimes with metrics, which are related as $g'_{\mu\nu}(x)=e^{2\omega(x)}g_{\mu\nu}(x)$ with a smooth real function $\omega(x)$. Or in other words, they differ only by multiplication with a positive scalar function on spacetime. The important thing is, those metrics have the same null geodesics.
This goes not without saying, because only timelike/spacelike curves in one metric will be timelike/spacelike curves in the other, but not geodesics.
Two metrics with this kind of relation are called \textit{conformally equivalent}. 
This gives us a way to represent the asymptotic behaviour of spacetimes at large distances.

Now, \textit{conformal compactification} is including infinity as a boundary of spacetime in a manifold by taking a function $\omega(x)$ that diverges while we approach infinity, so that infinity is brought into a finite distance.
\marginpar{sollten metriken damit nicht auch was zu tun haben?}

	We will now show this on an example, the ordinary flat Minkowski space, whose metric in spherical coordinates looks like
		\begin{equation}
			\diff s^2=- \diff t^2+ \diff r^2+r^2 \diff \Omega^2_2
		\end{equation}
	Because the interesting things are happening in the asymptotical behavior at $r \rightarrow \infty$ and $|t| \rightarrow \infty$, we parametrize them with the aid of $\arctan(x)$, so that the boundary is pulled in a finite distance.
		\begin{equation}
		\begin{split}
			T+R\equiv\arctan(t+r) \\
			T-R\equiv\arctan(t-r)
		\end{split}
		\end{equation}
	
	And now the metrics looks as follows:
		\begin{equation} \label{TRmetric}
			\diff s^2=
			\frac{1}{\cos^2(T+R)\cos^2(T-R)}
			\left[- \diff T^2+ \diff R^2+\left(\frac{\sin(2R)}{2}\right)^2 \diff \Omega^2_2 \right].
		\end{equation}	
					
%		\begin{figure}[tbp]	
%		\begin{center}
%		\includegraphics[scale=1]{flatpenrose}

%		\end{figure}
	This seems to be quite complicated, but if you have a look at \textbf{Figure \ref{flatpenrose}}, you will see, why we were doing this. The new ranges of our coordinates are $|T \pm R|< \pi/2, R\geq0$, and the spacetime was compactified by including the boundary at $|T \pm R| = \pi/2$. 
	
	The new boundary which are illustrated in \textbf{Figure \ref{flatpenrose}} on the right side, is divided into five parts:	
		\begin{tabbing}
			\hspace{0.1\linewidth} \= \hspace{0.4\linewidth} \= \hspace{0.1\linewidth} \= \hfill \kill
			$i^+$~~: \> future timelike infinity \> $J^+$~~: \> future null infinity \\
			$i^-$~~: \> past timelike infinity \> $J^-$~~: \> past null infinity\\
			\hspace{0.35\linewidth} \= \hspace{0.1\linewidth} \= \hfill \kill	
			~ \> $i^0$~~: \> spatial infinity 
		\end{tabbing}
	So timelike curves come from $i^-$ and go to $i^+$, same for null curves with $J^\mp$, the spatial geodesics are ending at $i^0$. Massless particles are entering/leaving at $i^\mp$ and massive particles at $J^\mp$. The scattering matrix\footnote{also called S-matrix} maps the states on $J^- \cup i^-$ to the states on $J^+ \cup i^+$.	
	
	Out of the diagram, we can see, that the Minkowski space does \textit{not} have \textit{event horizons}.

	\subsubsection{of de Sitter space \textbf{N}}
	\begin{figure}[tbp]
	 	\begin{center}
			\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{dspenrose}
		\end{center}
	  		\caption{Beschreibung}\label{dspenrose}
	\end{figure}
	Its metric is:
		\begin{equation}
			\diff s^2=- \diff \tau^2+\cosh^2\tau \diff \Omega^2_3
		\end{equation}
		Now we know, that de Sitter space has no infinite spatial boundary $i^0$, nor any light-like infinity $J^\mp$. That means, it is too complicated to find a formulation of de Sitter space in quantum theory and finding a S-matrix may be impossible. 
		
		But it has \textit{event horizons}! That means, observers, who are moving on timelike geodesics at vertical straight lines in the diagram \textbf{Figure \ref{dspenrose}} could be unable to communicate.

	\subsubsection{of Schwarzschild geometry \textbf{N}}
	
	For the Penrose diagram of the Schwarzschild geometry, we take the Kruskal Szekeres coordinates of \eqref{SchXT}. That lightens the compactification we need for the Penrose diagram a lot, because the difference between $(T,X,\Omega)$ coordinates and the Minkowski space coordinates $(t,r,\Omega)$ is just their range.\footnote{Minkowski: $-\infty < t < \infty, r\geq 0$; Kruskal: $X^2-T^2 > 1$}
	So the transformation is as it was for Minkowski space:
		\begin{equation}
			\begin{split}
			T'+X'\equiv \arctan(T+X) \\
			T'-X'\equiv \arctan(T-X)
			\end{split}		
		\end{equation}
	But instead we have now the coordinate range of $|X'\pm T'|< \pi/2$ and $|T|< \pi/4$ \marginpar{? warum $|T|$ und nicht $|T'|$}
	If you draw this into a diagramm, it looks like the Kruskal diagram in \textbf{Figure \ref{kruskal}}, but now the spacetime boundaries are shown too.

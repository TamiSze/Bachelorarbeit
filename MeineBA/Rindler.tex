	Now that we know  what entanglement is, we would also like to know, how much who is entangled with whom. In \textbf{Figure \ref{Rindler}} you can see a method which will help us, to reach that goal, the Rindler decomposition of Minkowski space.
	
	Therefore we split the Hilbert space into a factor $\Hil_L$ that acts on the fields $x<0$ and $\Hil_R$ for $x>0$. And each factor has its own basis of states with which we can decompose the vacuum.
	
	We now introduce the \textit{Lorentz boost\footnote{A Lorentz boost is a rotation-free Lorentz transformation, which is a Galilei-transformation in relativistic.\cite{ARTfliesbach} p.7} operator} $K_x$, which mixes x and t but does not act on the y or z direction. This operator exist in any relativistic QFT and looks in the free massive theory like this:
	\begin{equation}
		K_x = \frac{1}{2} \int \diff^3 x 
		\left[ x (\dot{\phi}^2 + \vec{\nabla} \phi \cdot \vec{\nabla} \phi + m^2 \phi^2) + t\dot{\phi} \partial_x \phi
		\right].
	\end{equation}
	It is not explicitly time-dependent, because if you plug it in Heisenberg's equation of motion the time-dependence of the fields cancels the explicit time dependence. \marginpar{Nachrechnen! (siehe QED Ã¼bung)} In all four regions i.e. wedges of \textbf{Figure \ref{Rindler}} the action of $K_x$ is well defined. 
	
	So in the right blue wedge this operator is evolving forward in time, which is indicated by the red line with the arrow pointing in the increasing $t$ direction. On the contrary $K_x$ is evolving backwards in time in the left blue wedge, where the arrow on the red line is pointing at decreasing t direction. The upper and lower wedge are again the future and the past region where the action of $K_x$ is spacelike. 
	This figure looks very alike the Kruskal extension in \textbf{Figure \ref{kruskal}} but be careful and don't mix them up.

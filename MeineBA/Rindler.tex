	Now that we know  what entanglement is, we would also like to know, with whom is who entangled. In \textbf{Figure \ref{Rindler}} you can see a methode which will help us, to reach that goal, the Rindler decomposition of Minkowski space.
	
	Therefore we split the Hilbert space into a factor $\Hil_L$ that acts on the fields $x<0$ and $\Hil_R$ for $x>0$. And each factor has its own basis of states with which we can decompose the vacuum. \marginpar{was meint hier "aufteilen"}
	
	We now introduce the \textit{Lorentz boost\footnote{A Lorentz boost is a rotation-free Lorentz transformation, which is a Gallilei-transformation in relativistic.[ARTflie√übach p.7]} operator} $K_x$, which mixes x and t, but leaves y and z like they are, because otherwise we could not map it on paper like in \textbf{Figure \ref{Rindler}}. This operator exist in any relativistic QFT and looks in the free massive theory like this:
	\begin{equation}
		K_x = \frac{1}{2} \int \diff^3 x 
		\left[ x (\dot{\phi} + \vec{\nabla} \phi \cdot \vec{\nabla} \phi + m^2 \phi^2) + t\dot{\phi} \partial_x \phi
		\right].
	\end{equation}
	It is not explicitly time-dependant, because the time-dependance of fields in the Heisenberg picture\footnote{Here the operators are following an equation of motion. [see Schwabl QM1 p.176]} is canceling the time-dependance of $K_x$ out.

	What happens, if we want to cross the $x=0$ surface? For finding that out, we put the system in a mixed state with
		\begin{equation} \label{mixed_state_firewall}
			\rho=\rho_L \otimes \rho_R
		\end{equation}
	instead of having a ground state $|\Omega\rangle$. Here $\rho_L$ and $\rho_R$ are the thermal density matrices, which we get if we trace out the respectively other one in the vacuum $|\Omega\rangle$.
	If the fields are completely discontinous like in \eqref{mixed_state_firewall} , the gradient term of the Hamiltonian will diverge at $x=0$. If you are an observer in the left or right Rindlers wedge it seems, that you just have vacuum state, but the energy is infinit. 
	
	Its typical field fluctuation is given by $\frac{1}{\epsilon}$ where $\epsilon$ is a short-distance length cutoff. \marginpar{was ist damit genau gemeint?} So it is valid that
		\begin{equation}
			\partial_x \phi|_{x=0} \propto \frac{1}{\epsilon^2}.
		\end{equation}
	Which means, that the gradient term in the Hamiltonian contributes
		\begin{equation}
			\diff x \int \diff^2 y (\partial_x\phi)^2 \propto 
			\epsilon \int \diff^2 y \frac{1}{\epsilon^4} 
			= \frac{A}{\epsilon^3}
		\end{equation}	
	The smaller $\epsilon$ is the bigger becomes the energy and $\epsilon$ is even to the third power.
	 			
	This is called a \textit{firewall}: A huge concentration of energy at $x=0$, that annihilates anybody who tries to jump through the Rindler horizon into the future wedge.
	
	For example the product states $|00\rangle$ and $|11\rangle$ of the states $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
	(|00\rangle \pm |11\rangle)$ which shall both have smooth horizons, should have them too, because of linearity of quantum mechanics. But as we just saw, no product state possibly can have a smooth horizon in QFT. So, for going smoothly through the Rindlers horizon we need not only any entanglement but it must have the \textit{right entanglement} too.

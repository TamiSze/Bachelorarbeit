\section{Contemplation of a fixed black hole}

Upto now we still considered the quantum field theory and classical black holes apart from each other. Combining them would require a theory of quantum gravity on which i will not go deeper in this thesis. But we can start with a much simpler problem that would be the quantum field theory in a fixed black hole backround. Physically this means, that we're sending $G$ to zero and the mass of the black hole $M$ to infinity so that the Schwarzschild radius $r_s = 2GM$ ist fixed. This can be assured by sending $\frac{M}{m_p}$ to infinity, where $m_p =\frac{1}{\sqrt{8\pi G}}$ is the Planck mass. 

This approximation is justified, which we can see by the example of a black hole with the mass of our sun:
	\begin{align}
		\frac{m_p}{M_{solar}} \approx 10^{-38}
	\end{align}	 
In this type of scale, the Schwarzschild radius is in order of kilometers (sun: $r_s=3 \unit{km}$) where we could imagine doing experiments.

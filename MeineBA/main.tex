\section{Introduction}
	This work is up to the basics of theoretical examination of black holes. Even for non-physicists, these astronomical objects are the most interessing and fascinating ones and despite other subjects in physics, everyone heard of it before in the popular science.
	
	So my task was to rewrite parts of Jerusalem Lectures on Black Holes and Quantum Information of Daniel Harlow which you can have a look onto here \cite{JerusalemLectures}. Most time I didn't mark the pictures or formulas I took from Daniel Harlows lectures, because it is clear, that nearly everything was his work. I tried to make it possible for a bachelor student to understand this part of the lecture by introducing more basics, but this subject is still very hard without having heard a QFT lecture. To my regret this part of theoretical physics is still not experimentally verified because black holes are difficult to monitor especially near it. 
	
	The thesis beginns with the introduction of different spaces and geometries that were found by solving the Einstein equations. After that we will establish new parametrizations like the tornoise coorinates in order to include the whole spacetime into a diagram, which will be called Penrose diagrams and will haunt us through every theory about black holes. 
	Then I give a short introduction about quantum field theory and entanglement which we need to know for  the rindler space and what Hawking radiation is. In the end we will have a look at the problem, that information can't just be removed by black holes.
	
	\subsection{Conventions}
	The whole time I will use of course the natural units $c = \hbar = 1$. In addition in the most chapters we will set the Schwarzschildradius $r_s =2GM$ to one for simplicity. This will be retracted when we will discuss the black holes mass as time-dependent.

Mail Antwort vom Autor ^^:
Tau is an FRW time coordinate, 2.14 uses the standard "global" coordinates for de Sitter space.  You might want to look in Sean Carroll's textbook for more information.

classical black hole formation:

-the Schwarzschild horizon has a property which can be detected locally in time: for any sphere of constant $r$ with $r<1$
- any null geodesics of these spheres which starts out orthogonal converges towards the other null geodesics. And if this is a compact 2-dim surface, it's called a \textit{closed trapped surface}.
- An apparent horizon is now a surface which is a boundary of a connected set of closed trapped surfaces.
- it is shown in blue dots it figure 5. as you can see, the apparent horizon does form itself, when the photon shell crosses the event horizon (black dots)

Quantum field theory:

Here the Hilbert space is like an infinite tensor product over all points in space, while we have finite degrees of freedom at each point. 
For example, we take a scalar field $\psi(x)$ where there is only a one degree of freedom at each spatial point. 

Entanglement:

If the fields are completely discontinous like in \eqref{mixed_state_firewall} , the gradient term of the Hamiltonian will diverge at $x=0$. If you are an observer in the left or right Rindlers wedge it seems, that you just have vacuum state, but the energy is infinit. Its typical field fluctuation is given by $\frac{1}{\epsilon}$ where $\epsilon$ is a short-distance length cutoff \marginpar{was ist damit genau gemeint?}
